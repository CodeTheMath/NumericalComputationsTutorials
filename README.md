# NumericalComputationsTutorials
This repository will be systematically developed to contain Jupyter Notebooks and Python packages presenting numerical computations procedures I discus on CodeTheMath YT Chanel. All of this content will be available in ready tu use interactive form provided with Binder platform. The content will be organised as follows: Each set of related topics will be stored in a separated directory. Each topic will be presented in a separated Jupyter Notebook available in a interactive form via Binder. Each topic will be presented in details on CodeTheMath YT Chanel as a separated video. Publication schedule assume realisation of two topics weekly. I hope to have enough time :-)
